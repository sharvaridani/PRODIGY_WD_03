Objective: The goal is to be the first player to place three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid.

Gameplay:

    The game begins with an empty grid.
    Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on any empty cell on the grid.
    The first player starts with "X".
    The players alternate turns after each move.

    A player wins the game if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
    If all 9 squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game is a draw.

End of Game:

    The game ends when a player wins or when all cells are filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.]
